# deepstream-yolov9-qat

This project focuses on implementing the YOLOv9 model on the Jetson Orin Nano, exploring various configurations to enhance real-time object detection performance.

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon ideas and code from two other projects. For more insights and related code, please refer to the following repositories:

- [yolov9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9)
- [yolov9-qat](https://github.com/levipereira/yolov9-qat)
- [DeepStream-Yolo](https://github.com/marcoslucianops/DeepStream-Yolo)

I also use Docker images for the Jetson provided by:

- [jetson-containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers)

These Docker images help simplify setting up and running our project on Jetson devices.
